                        The period of the High Middle Ages saw several important developments within the
                        German-speaking areas of Europe. The first was the establishment of the trading
                        conglomerate known as the Hanseatic League, which was dominated by a number of German
                        port cities along the Baltic and North Sea coasts. The second was the growth of a
                        crusading element within German christendom. This led to the establishment of the
                        State of the Teutonic Order, established along the Baltic coast of what is today
                        Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This crusader state led to the Christianization of
                        these regions, as well as an extension of Germanic culture and language eastward. Also
                        during this period, German Emperors became embroiled in conflicts with the Catholic
                        Church over various political issues, resulting in the Investiture Controversy.
                        <br><br>
                        In the Late Middle Ages, the regional dukes, princes, and bishops gained power at
                        the expense of the emperors. Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation within the
                        Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern and eastern states became Protestant,
                        while most of the southern and western states remained Catholic. The two parts of the
                        Holy Roman Empire clashed in the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648), which was ruinous to
                        the twenty million civilians living in both parts. The Thirty Years' War brought
                        tremendous destruction to Germany; more than 1/4 of the population in the German states
                        were killed by the catastrophic war. The estates of the Holy Roman Empire attained a
                        high extent of autonomy in the Peace of Westphalia, some of them being capable of their
                        own foreign policies or controlling land outside of the Empire, the most important being
                        Austria, Prussia, Bavaria and Saxony. With the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars
                        from 1803 to 1815, feudalism fell away by reforms and the dissolution of the Holy Roman
                        Empire. Thereafter liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The German
                        revolutions of 1848–49 failed. The Industrial Revolution modernized the German economy,
                        led to the rapid growth of cities and the emergence of the socialist movement in
                        Germany. Prussia, with its capital Berlin, grew in power. German universities became
                        world-class centers for science and humanities, while music and art flourished. The
                        unification of Germany (excluding Austria) was achieved under the leadership of the
                        Chancellor Otto von Bismarck with the formation of the German Empire in 1871. This
                        resulted in the Kleindeutsche Lösung, ("small Germany solution", Germany without
                        Austria), rather than the Großdeutsche Lösung, ("greater Germany solution", Germany
                        with Austria). The new Reichstag, an elected parliament, had only a limited role in
                        the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in colonial expansion in Africa
                        and the Pacific.

                        By 1900, Germany was the dominant power on the European continent and its rapidly expanding
                        industry had surpassed Britain's while provoking it in a naval arms race. Since
                        Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia, Germany had led the Central Powers in World War
                        I (1914–1918) against the Allied Powers. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced
                        to pay war reparations by the Treaty of Versailles and was stripped of its colonies and
                        significant territory along its borders. The German Revolution of 1918–19 put an end to the
                        German Empire and established the Weimar Republic, an ultimately unstable parliamentary
                        democracy. In January 1933, Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party, used the economic
                        hardships of the Great Depression along with popular resentment over the terms imposed on
                        Germany at the end of World War I to establish a totalitarian regime. This Nazi Germany
                        made racism, especially antisemitism, a central tenet of its policies, and became
                        increasingly aggressive with its territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met.
                        Germany quickly remilitarized, then annexed Austria and the German-speaking areas of
                        Czechoslovakia in 1938. After seizing the rest of Czechoslovakia, Germany launched an
                        invasion of Poland, which quickly grew into World War II. During the war, the Nazi regime
                        established a systematic genocide program known as the Holocaust which killed 17 million
                        people, including 6 million Jews (representing 2/3rd of the European Jewish population of
                        1933),[1] Following the Allied invasion of Normandy in June, 1944, the German Army was
                        pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945. Under occupation by the
                        Allies, Austria was again made a separate country, denazification efforts took place, large
                        populations under former German-occupied territories were displaced, German territories were
                        split up by the victorious powers. Germany spent the entirety of the Cold War era divided
                        into the NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany. Germans also fled
                        from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid economic expansion, and
                        became the dominant economy in Western Europe.
