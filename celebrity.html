                    <h1>Johann Sebastian Bach</h1>
                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Sebastian_Bach">
                        (31 March 1685 – 28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the late Baroque period.
                        He is known for his orchestral music such as the Brandenburg Concertos; instrumental
                        compositions such as the Cello Suites; keyboard works such as the Goldberg Variations and The
                        Well-Tempered Clavier; organ works such as the Schubler Chorales and the Toccata and Fugue in
                        D minor; and vocal music such as the St Matthew Passion and the Mass in B minor. Since the
                        19th-century Bach revival he has been generally regarded as one of the greatest composers in
                        the history of Western music.<br><br>

                        The Bach family already counted several composers when Johann Sebastian was born as the
                        last child of a city musician in Eisenach. After being orphaned at the age of 10, he lived
                        for five years with his eldest brother Johann Christoph, after which he continued his
                        musical education in Lüneburg. From 1703 he was back in Thuringia, working as a musician
                        for Protestant churches in Arnstadt and Mühlhausen and, for longer stretches of time, at
                        courts in Weimar, where he expanded his organ repertory, and Köthen, where he was mostly
                        engaged with chamber music. From 1723 he was employed as Thomaskantor (cantor at St Thomas's)
                        in Leipzig. There he composed music for the principal Lutheran churches of the city, and for
                        its university's student ensemble Collegium Musicum. From 1726 he published some of his
                        keyboard and organ music. In Leipzig, as had happened during some of his earlier positions,
                        he had difficult relations with his employer, a situation that was little remedied when he
                        was granted the title of court composer by his sovereign, Augustus III, Elector of Saxony
                        and King of Poland, in 1736. In the last decades of his life he reworked and extended many
                        of his earlier compositions. He died of complications after eye surgery in 1750 at the age
                        of 65.<br><br>

                        Bach enriched established German styles through his mastery of counterpoint, harmonic, and
                        motivic organisation,[4] and his adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad,
                        particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include hundreds of cantatas, both
                        sacred and secular. He composed Latin church music, Passions, oratorios, and motets. He
                        often adopted Lutheran hymns, not only in his larger vocal works, but for instance also in
                        his four-part chorales and his sacred songs. He wrote extensively for organ and for other
                        keyboard instruments. He composed concertos, for instance for violin and for harpsichord,
                        and suites, as chamber music as well as for orchestra. Many of his works employ the genres
                        of canon and fugue.

                    <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein">
                        (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely
                        acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists of all time.
                        Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made
                        important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity
                        and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics. His mass–energy equivalence
                        formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most
                        famous equation".[9] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of
                        science.[10][11] He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to
                        theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
                        effect",[12] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual
                        achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".
                        <br><br>
                        In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis ('miracle year'), Einstein
                        published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined the theory of the photoelectric
                        effect, explained Brownian motion, introduced special relativity, and demonstrated
                        mass-energy equivalence. Einstein thought that the laws of classical mechanics could no
                        longer be reconciled with those of the electromagnetic field, which led him to develop
                        his special theory of relativity. He then extended the theory to gravitational fields;
                        he published a paper on general relativity in 1916, introducing his theory of gravitation.
                        In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the
                        universe. He continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum
                        theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules.
                        He also investigated the thermal properties of light and the quantum theory of
                        radiation, which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light.
                        <br><br>
                        However, for much of the later part of his career, he worked on two ultimately
                        unsuccessful endeavors. First, despite his great contributions to quantum mechanics,
                        he opposed what it evolved into, objecting that "God does not play dice". Second, he
                        attempted to devise a unified field theory by generalizing his geometric theory of
                        gravitation to include electromagnetism. As a result, he became increasingly isolated
                        from the mainstream of modern physics.

                    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven">
                        German composer and pianist. Beethoven remains one of the most admired composers in the
                        history of Western music; his works rank amongst the most performed of the classical
                        music repertoire and span the transition from the Classical period to the Romantic era
                        in classical music. His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and
                        late periods. His early period, during which he forged his craft, is typically
                        considered to have lasted until 1802. From 1802 to around 1812, his middle period
                        showed an individual development from the styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus
                        Mozart, and is sometimes characterized as heroic. During this time, he began to grow
                        increasingly deaf. In his late period, from 1812 to 1827, he extended his innovations in
                        musical form and expression.
                        <br><br>
                        Beethoven was born in Bonn. His musical talent was obvious at an early age. He was
                        initially harshly and intensively taught by his father Johann van Beethoven. Beethoven
                        was later taught by the composer and conductor Christian Gottlob Neefe, under whose
                        tutelage he published his first work, a set of keyboard variations, in 1783. He found
                        relief from a dysfunctional home life with the family of Helene von Breuning, whose
                        children he loved, befriended, and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which
                        subsequently became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then gained
                        a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and he was soon patronized by Karl Alois, Prince
                        Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his three Opus 1 piano trios
                        (the earliest works to which he accorded an opus number) in 1795.
                        <br><br>
                        His first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, premiered in 1800, and his first
                        set of string quartets was published in 1801. Despite his hearing deteriorating during
                        this period, he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth Symphonies in 1804
                        and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto
                        (No. 5, Op. 73, known as the Emperor), dedicated to his frequent patron Archduke Rudolf
                        of Austria, was premiered in 1811, without Beethoven as soloist. He was almost
                        completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He
                        described his problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his
                        Heiligenstadt Testament (1802) to his brothers and his unsent love letter to an unknown
                        "Immortal Beloved" (1812).
